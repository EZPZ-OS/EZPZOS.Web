 * This is just a placeholder for dish detail page. Data structure and layout is not determined yet.
 * Till now, the only implementation will be add the Path of this DishDetail.tsx into the file Routes.tsx.
 * This placeholder is linked to every dish in our MockZCoreMenuData as a field "dishDetailPath: '../DishDetail'".
 *  (Read the src/Components/MenuList/MockCoreMenuData/MockCoreMenuData.tsx for further demonstration.)
 *
 * As per implementation, following files thus required an extra string prop (just as our mock data):
 *  - AddButton.jsx
 *  - CoreMenuDishCard.jsx
 *  - CoreMenu.tsx
 *
